        <p>HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning</p>
        <h2> b and strong elements</h2>
        <p> The html element b defines bold text without any extra importance</p> 
        <b> This is an example of bolded sentece.</b>
        <strong> make sure you have read this information</strong>
        <p> The HTML i element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.</p>
        <i> this is italic</i>
        <p> The HTML em element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.</p>
        <em>This is how emphasized texts look like</em>
        <p>the html "small" defines smaller texts</p>
        <small>this is an one of the elements of formatting which makes texts appear smaller</small>
        <p> the html "mark" stands for texts that should be highlighted</p>
        <p>this is very <mark>important</mark>to pay attention</p>
        <p>The HTML "del" element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text</p>
        <p>for example</p> <p> my favorite color is <del>blue</del>red</p>
        <p>The HTML "ins" element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. </p>
        <p>for example,</p> <p> my favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>
        <p>The HTML "sub" element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.</p>
        <p> for example,</p> <p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub>text.</p>
        <h3>The End of formatting</h3>
